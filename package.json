  "description": "This is a full stack app I created which allows the user to favorite any mountain within the U.S. and plan trips to a mountain.  They are also able to friend other users and join their trips. This program utilizes user authentication and password hashing, is built with materialize, and uses MongoDB / mongoose on the backend.  I personally created the API for the mountains for all 300+ mountains within the United States.",
